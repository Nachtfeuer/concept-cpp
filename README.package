Welcome to the concept-cpp package
==================================
It's a kind of private knowledge database,
test environment and prototyping environment
around the topics c++11 and cmake.

For now we provide header only code.
Simply include/use like this:

    #include <math/vector.h>
    // ...
    math::vector v1(4, 5);
    std::cout << "v1.length() = " << std::v1.length() << std::endl;
    // ...
