README
======

Welcome
-------
Welcome to the README of my personal C++11/cmake refererence project.
It's a kind of knowledge database and small test environment.
The purpose is - of course - to keep everything clean, simple and
well documented.


Current Content
---------------
 - implementation of an easy to use unittesting framework.
 - pattern classes like a factory.
 - math classes like a 2d vector.
 - algorithm functions like 'sorted'.
 - you can create HTML documentation with doxygen.
 - supports code coverage report
 - supports cppcheck


Next Action Items (planned)
---------------------------
 - providing report generator for unittesting framework.
 - singleton decorator class (remove singleton from factory)
 - performance measurement for tests.
 - passsing command line parameters to runner (unittests)
 - generating Jenkins compatible report for unittests.


CMake
-----
Here's the minimum way to go:
```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
```

A list of further useful options:
```
 cmake -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles" ..
 cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
 cmake -DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION=ON ..
```

You also can do:
```
 make check       (do not use make test since it does NOT build)
 make run         (does run the test without "ctest")
 make memcheck    (wraps use of the valgrind tool)
 make doc         (generates doxygen documentation)
 make coverage    (runs the tests and generates HTML coverage report)
 make cppcheck    (runs cppcheck agains the sources)
```

For creating a RPM package (sudo is important):
```
 sudo make package
```

Code Coverage
-------------
```
make coverage
```

I'm using this: http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php
When you run this then following dependencies are ensured:

 - compilation and linkage of the test binary
 - running the test
 - capturing the coverage data
 - generating the report

What remains ... at least what I do:

```
firefox coverage/index.html
```

You can keep that page open and when you run again the coverage
after you have added or modified tests then simply refresh the page.
